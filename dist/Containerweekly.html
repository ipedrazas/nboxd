<br>
Welcome to Container Weekly issue #17.&nbsp;Don't forget that you can participate in making this newsletter by emailing your comments and suggestions to&nbsp;david@containerweekly.com,&nbsp;I really appreciate your feedback.<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point in time, I think everyone agrees that the raise of containers and micro services brought a new set of issues that operators and developers have to deal with. The first one of those issues being how we put together all the necessary pieces to run an application. I read two very interesting blog posts about that topic this week.<br>
<br>
The first one leverages Docker Compose and Mesos to easily deploy distributed systems. I have to admit that Compose has grown on me over time. The document format has become really descriptive and easy to understand, and having release binaries made me reconsider my initial concerns about the project:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://spof.io/blog/2015/06/23/mesos-sandbox-using-docker-compose">https://spof.io/blog/2015/06/23/mesos-sandbox-using-docker-compose</a><br>
<br>
Conversations about tools&nbsp;that try to describe the way you organize applications, like Compose does, always move to the <em>"But my application is very special and it needs a set of requirements never seen before"</em> field.&nbsp;People always have very good reasons to believe that, and I find those conversations very interesting, you end up learning something new every time. That's what I thought this article about containerizing opinionated applications so interesting:<br>
<br>

<br>
But we're introducing other type of complexity&nbsp;once we have our application separated by clear concerns. How do we test that the whole system works?<br>
<br>
First, we need to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the different ways we can test our application. AMC Queue published the past week a fantastic article that covers this topic:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2800697">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2800697</a><br>
<br>
Once we get a better understanding of the theory, we can move to the practice. Several companies have adopted the popular Chaos engineering popularized by Netflix and a central piece in the distributed testing infrastructure.<br>
<br>
This blog post explains how the Azure team adopted chaos monkeys to make their search service more reliable. What I find more interesting is how they analyze their results and apply them to improve the service:<br>

<br>
Now, the problem we just introduced is how to build our&nbsp;testing infrastructure to test the&nbsp;distributed application. This blog post explains how to use Kubernetes to build load testing infrastructure. It's also a good reminder about using clouds&nbsp;for something else beside deploying production applications:<br>

<br>
Newspapers and magazines learned this lesson long time ago. If you didn't see this article about how a famous magazine prepared their website for a massive number of visits after publishing some controversial pictures, I totally recommend you to spend some time going through it:<br>

<em>Extra post:</em>&nbsp;If you didn't have enough with this week's articles, feel free to check the making off of an awesome demo where a container travels all over the world with a minimum interruption of service:<br>
